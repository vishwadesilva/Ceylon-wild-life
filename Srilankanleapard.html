            <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a unique and fascinating subspecies, endemic to the island nation of Sri Lanka. This particular leopard has adapted to the diverse ecosystems found in Sri Lanka, including dense jungles, scrublands, and grasslands. Recognized by its distinct rosettes and a generally smaller size compared to other leopard subspecies, the Sri Lankan leopard faces specific challenges and plays a crucial role in the island's ecology.

              The Sri Lankan leopard's habitat is limited to the island, making it a vital component of Sri Lanka's biodiversity. With its habitat ranging from the lowland rainforests to the higher elevations of Horton Plains National Park, this subspecies showcases adaptability to varying altitudes and climates. Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan leopard is classified as endangered, facing threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching, and human-wildlife conflicts.
              
              Conservation efforts for the Sri Lankan leopard are essential to preserve the unique biodiversity of Sri Lanka. Initiatives focus on protecting its habitats, mitigating conflicts with local communities, and promoting awareness to ensure the survival of this magnificent and distinctive subspecies. As a flagship species for conservation in Sri Lanka, the fate of the Sri Lankan leopard reflects the broader challenges faced by wildlife in the region, highlighting the need for concerted efforts to safeguard its future.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="leopardpara">
          <p><b>Consequences: </b> Lankan leopards face significant habitat loss due to human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development. This results in the fragmentation of their natural habitats, isolating populations and reducing the availability of prey.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Mechanisms to Reduce the Threat:</b> Conservation organizations and government agencies in Sri Lanka are working to establish and maintain protected areas, corridors, and buffer zones to connect fragmented habitats. This helps maintain genetic diversity and ensures the leopards' ability to roam freely, reducing the impact of habitat loss.</p>

        </section>
          <p><b>Consequences:</b> As human populations expand into leopard habitats, conflicts arise over competition for resources. Leopards may prey on livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by local communities. This exacerbates the strain on leopard populations and fuels negative perceptions of the species.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Mechanisms to Reduce the Threat:</b> Conservation initiatives include community-based programs that raise awareness about coexisting with leopards. Implementing secure livestock enclosures, providing compensation for livestock losses, and employing early-warning systems can help mitigate conflicts, fostering a more harmonious relationship between leopards and local communities.</p>

      <P> 3. Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade</P>
    </section>
    <section class="leopardpara">
        <p><b>Consequences:</b> Sri Lankan leopard faces the threat of poaching for its skin, bones, and other body parts, driven by illegal wildlife trade. This activity poses a direct threat to the survival of the species and contributes to the decline of leopard populations.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Mechanisms to Reduce the Threat:</b> Sri Lanka has implemented stricter law enforcement measures against poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Enhanced patrolling in protected areas, intelligence gathering, and collaboration with international agencies are critical components of these efforts. Additionally, educational programs and awareness campaigns are conducted to inform the public about the consequences of wildlife trade and the importance of leopard conservation.</p>
